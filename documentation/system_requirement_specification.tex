\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
The system will provide a better way to monitor Patient rehabilitation.  The system will be targeted towards nursing homes and rehab hospitals which require monitoring of elderly people, recovering athetes, and people with balance issues. The system will further provide independent mobility while monitoring a Patients progress.

\subsection{Project Scope}
To develop a mobile pedemeter, that is worn by the Patient. The device must be cheap, wireless, rugged and easy to use. Build a system to monitor activity inside and outside the home. The device can be used as a monitoring tool for compliance with perscribed activities intended for theraputic development of motor functions.

\subsection{Business Context}
The requirements of the project are drawn from the anticipated needs of Patients, Clinicians, and researches working in rehabilitation hospitals and nursing homes.  Limited funding will be provided by the Software Engineering Department at Clarkson University. The timeline indicates the project must be completed in a 15 week period.  Each member of the team is also a full time student and therefore has a constrainted amount of time and effort to be put forth relative to a full time employee.

\subsection{Definitions}\label{defs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Clinician - Person directing and monitoring Patients, their progress, and their daily tasks.

\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{Product Functionality}	
The system will provide the following features:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Wii Remote attached to the Patient's belt will transmit walking data to the PDA carried by the Patient.
\item The PDA will transmit data to a remote server as well as update the Patient's tasks periodically. 
\item A Web UI will be hosted by the server that allows Clinicians/Researchers to login to view Patient progress, statistics, chart/graph trends, etc. 
\item A PDA UI that will be running in Windows Mobile that will interface with the Wii Remote. This UI will also provide Patients with "Tasks for the Day" as well as a "PDA Statistics Page".
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{System Context}
This system is comparable to an everyday pedometer used to monitor walking activity. The major improvement lies in the interactive features provided to the Clinician Researcher and Patient. Real-time data analysis and feedback is provided to help ensure effective Patient treatment. This system provides the ability to have both independent mobility as well as closely monitored workout regimens. 

\subsection{User Characteristics}

\subsubsection{Administrator}
This user's main concern is to manage Clinician and Researcher accounts on the Web UI. They will be responsible for Adding/Removing/Editing these accounts.

\subsubsection{Clinician}
This user's main concern will be view the progress of a particular Patient on a particular set of tasks. This user only wants to view information about a specific Patient. From this information the Clinician can manage the Patient's Daily Tasks. No computing knowledge is assumed, the Web UI will be learned in 1 to 2 hours. 

\subsubsection{Researcher}
This user's main task will be to view and identify useful trends in the database. The Researcher will work side-by-side with the Clinician in order to improve Daily Task regimens. This user will focus their efforts on Patients as a whole, and how they are performing against these Daily Task regimens. No computing knowledge is assumed, the Web UI will be learned in 1 to 2 hours.

\subsubsection{Patient}
This user is only concerned with rectifying their personal wellness. There are some underlying assumptions made about the Patient/caregiver for use of this system:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Some amount of manual dexterity (interact with the PDA touch-screen)
\item Clear vision (can observe walking statistics, read alert messages, etc.)
\item Ability to read written English words on the PDA
\item Good hearing (can react to PDA alerts)
\end{enumerate}
No assumptions are made about the level of PC literacy of the Patient/caregiver.


\subsection {Operation Environment}

\begin{enumerate}
\item PDA - Palm Treo 750 running Windows Mobile 5
\item Remote server running Windows Server
\end{enumerate}

The PDA and Wii Remote will be carried by the Patient when a Daily Task is performed. The Server will be located in a remote location (at the rehab hospital, clinic, etc.). The Clinician and Researcher will log onto the Web UI hosted by the server via a remote machine.

\subsection {Design and Implementation Constraints}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Limited Budget - Limited funds constricts our options concerning both hardware and software. This may prevent us from using the best and most efficient tools that would better the project.

\item Limited Time - All developers are full-time students who need to dedicate their time to other assignments and projects as well.

\item Licensing Issues - Both the PDA and Wii Remote were developed by outside parties. This may bring up lisencing issues concerning what we want to use the products for and how we want to use them, as opposed to what the developer companies allow them to be used for.

\item PDA use is restricted to using only the Palm Treo. A Windows OS is required for the PDA/server implementation.

\item GUI's must be developed as easy to use for non-technologically savvy individuals, including the elderly and young children.

\end{enumerate}


\subsection {User Objectives}

The Clinician wants to view the progress of a particular Patient and provide feedback to that Patient regarding their performance. The Clinician will achieve this through statistics/charts/graphs displayed in the Web UI. 
The Researcher wants to identify useful trends present in groups of Patient data. The Researcher will achieve this through statistics/charts/graphs displayed in the Web UI. 
The Patient wants to improve their personal wellness. The system will help the Patient achieve this by:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Providing real-time feedback/statistics to the Patient whilst exercising
\item Provide statistics for the past week
\item Providing an easy to use interface that shows the specific tasks for the day
\end{enumerate}

\subsection {Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The PDA is able to make a secure, reliable Bluetooth connection to the PDA and successfully transfer raw data from the Wii Remote to the PDA.
\item The PDA has enough room to store a days worth of raw data from the Wii Remote.
\item The Wii Remote's battery life will last an entire day.
\item The PDA can connect to the server and pass transfer raw data and receive update information from server through a secure, reliable and wireless connection.

\section{Non Functional Requirements}
\subsection{Performance Requirements }
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Wii Remote must be able to communicate clearly and efficiently with the PDA to guarantee accurate results.
\item The Wii Remote must be able to notify the Patient when the Daily Task is being done correctly.
\item The PDA must monitor the status of the Wii Remote and display a message on the screen to the Patient.
\item The PDA needs to be able to efficiently and quickly send data to the server. 
\item The database on the server needs to be set up to effectively store data coming from the PDA.
\item The PDA should notify the Patient when the memory becomes full.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection {Safety Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the battery life becomes low, the PDA must save data before the battery dies to prevent data loss
\item The Wii Remote should be able to detect sporadic or unsafe movement to prevent injury to the Patient.
\item The Wii Remote should be able to detect the falling of a Patient. Possibly able to notify 911.
\item The PDA should save a copy of the data before sending it to the server in case of connection/data transfer issues. This will prevent data loss.
\item The PDA should notify the Patient when the memory becomes full to prevent data loss. 
\item Accounts on the PDA and client side must be password protected so access to data can only be seen by the Patient or doctor. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Security Requirements }
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinicians and Researchers must enter correct credentials in order to log into Web UI.
\item Clinicians and Researchers have different levels of access to data.  For example, Clinicians can view Patient information such as name and address, while Patients remain anonymous to Researchers.
\item Patient information resides on a secure database.
\item The data transfer between the PDA and the Server must be secure, as the data transmitted is private.
\item 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Software Quality Requirements }
\begin{enumerate}
\item The integrated Wii Remote and PDA should be easy for the Patient to pick up and use with a fairly small learning curve.
\item Web UI is usable over the major internet browsers at the time of release.
\item Web UI is easy to understand and requires little to no training.
\item Client GUI is extremely easy to understand due to the average user very likely having little to no experience with technology, such as the very old and very young.
\item Code must be robust enough to allow Wii Remote to detect many different things from simple steps to someone falling.
\end{enumerate}

\caption{Preliminary object orient domain analysis for the server and pda software.}
\label{fig: prelim ooda}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item User - Abstract base class that represents all users of the system. This class will provide information pertaining to when the user was created, username/password, and ID. 
\item Patient - The Patient user class must be appropriately implemented to model user interaction with the Wii Remote and PDA.
\item Clinician - The Clinician domain object must be modeled to allow for logins/interaction with the Web UI.  
\item Researcher - The Researcher domain object must be modeled to allow for logins/interaction with the Web UI. 
\item Connection - This object is the base class for all connections made by the PDA. It will contain information regarding up time, number of connection retries, and last lost connection.
\item Server Connection - This object will manage the connection between the PDA and the Server. This includes initial connection set-up, as well as connection retries when the connection is lost. 
\item Wii Remote-PDA Connection - This object will manage the connection between the Wii Remote and the PDA. This includes information pertaining to which Patient the pair of devices is assigned to.
\item Update Manager - This object will deal with retrieving task updates as well as data dumping to the Server. The Update Manager will use the Server Connection object to establish a connection between the PDA and Server.
\item Alert - This object will display alert messages on the PDA. This will be used for connection messages, task updates, exercise alerts, etc.   
\item Data - This object will represent all of the exercise data that is collected and analyzed. This includes the raw data that is gathered from the Wii Remote, as well as computed statistics, graphs, charts, etc. 
\item Wii Remote Exercise Raw Data - This object will inherit from Data and will represent all of the raw exercise data that is gathered from the Wii Remote over bluetooth. The data represented in this object will be run through algorithms to compute relevant real-time statistics on the PDA. 
\item Server Statistical Data - This object will represent all of the statistics computed on the Server. This includes information pertaining to Patient Health Charts, Daily Task PDA Statistics, Group Patient Charts, and Patient Completion Charts.  
\item Task for the Day - This object will represent the number of walking steps a Patient must achieve in a given day. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Operational Scenarios}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The PDA and the Wii Remote must be connected before they are given to a Patient.  An alert is sent to the PDA when it receives connection from the Wii Remote and sends an acknowledgement.  If the PDA and Wii Remote are not paired, they must have a discoverable mode for a connection to occur in the future.  The PDA must also have a connection with the server to send data to be stored in a database.

\item The PDA receives data from the Wii Remote and it is stored in the PDA memory.  The PDA will notify the Patient of PDA Statistics in real time.  The PDA starts running scripts for analysis of stored data.  The PDA dumps data to the server. The PDA connects to the server and sends the username and password. The server reponds with an authentication complete if the username and password are correct.  If the connection fails the PDA keeps trying to reconnect and dump data to the server.

\item There must be a web UI hosted by a server that provides a way for all users to access data available to them.  Each user will have a unique username and password.

\item The user starts the application on the PDA by entering a username and password and is directed to their account page with the PDA Statistics Page displayed.  The PDA will connect to the server to itemize the Patient's tasks for the day in an easy to read font.  The tasks page will also have a close button to return the user to the home page.  The PDA will display an alert message for the Patient when a task is complete.

\item The Clinician will log into the web UI by entering a username and password.  The Clinician will have the ability to create a profile for a new Patient with all data being hosted on a database, this profile will be linked to a specified PDA and Wii Remote.  The Clinician will also be able to graph Patient data.  Data should be in human readable form.

\item The Clinician can also view various reports and graphs on a certain Patient's progress.  Also on the web UI will be a Patient Health Chart displaying how the Patient has improved or worsened over time.  The web UI will display a list of Patients for the Clinician currently logged in.  The server should provide links to each Patient's profile for the Clinician to view.  The web UI should also provide the Clinician the ability to change or modify tasks for Patients.

\item The Researcher will log into the web UI by entering a username and password.

\item The PDA will monitor the status of the Wii Remote battery.  When the battery power is low, the PDA will alert the user by displaying a message and causing the Wii Remote to vibrate.
\end{enumerate}
