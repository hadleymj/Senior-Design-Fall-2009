\section{Introduction}
This document states the high level design for the Mobile Pedometer system. This document should be used by the designers and developers as a basis for the implementation of the system, as it also contains system level use cases, and state diagrams.  The goal of this high level design document is to make the reader knowledgeable on the structural design of the system, as well as more knowledgeable about what the system does/is capable of doing.
The Activity Monitor system will provide a better way to monitor patient rehabilitation using a Wii Remote and a PDA (Palm Treo 750). The system will be targeted towards nursing homes and rehab hospitals which require monitoring of elderly people, recovering athletes, and people with balance issues. The system will further provide independent mobility while monitoring a patients progress with prescribed Daily Tasks. 
To perform this, we have developed a Web UI, complete with a database application, which is easy to use and can safely and securely store a patients data.

\newpage

\section{Use Cases}
The diagram below shows all of the interactions each user will be able to do with the system once they log in or power on. Patients will interact with the PDA, while Researchers and Clinicians interact with the Web UI.
All patients have the ability to start the PDA application, begin their daily task, upload data to the server, and complete their daily task.
Researchers and Clinicians share many uses of the system, including Viewing Patient Health Charts, Logging into the Web UI, and Viewing Patient Completion Charts. The Clinician has some accesses to the system that a Researcher does not however. The Clinician may Add Patients to the Web UI as well as assign Daily Tasks.
Researchers may view Group Patient Health Charts to compile trends.

\section{Object Interface Specification}

\subsection{PDA to Server Interfaces}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{PDA_to_Server_Interface_Diagram.png}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Authentication}
\subparagraph{Description}
The main purpose of the authentication is to verify that the correct user is trying to access the patients information. At the authentication screen, the user will enter their username and password. The username and password that was entered is sent to the server. If the information is correct ACK is sent back by the server. If not, NACK is sent back, and the connection is closed. Once the information is verified, the validation is sent to from the server to the database. 
\subparagraph{Trigger}
This task occurs when the PDA is handshaking with the Server during the initialization of a connection. This connection could either be triggered by the need to download the daily task or the need to dump data to the server.

\paragraph{Data Dump}
\subparagraph{Description} 
The data dump is used to send the information stored on the PDA for the day to the database. At the end of the day, the data is sent over an open connection to the server. When the server receives the information, an ACK is sent back. Once this is done, the information is sent from the server and stored into the database. 
\subparagraph{Trigger}
The data dump task is triggered by the completion of a day. The actual data dump request occurs after authentication with the Server.

\paragraph{Request Daily Task}
\subparagraph{Description}
The user must be able to request a daily task from the database. At the beginning of the day, or while a data dump is occurring, the user sends the request to the server. When this request is received by the server, the server will search through the database to retrieve the tasks for the specified users. When the tasks are found, they are sent back to the PDA, allowing the user to view them. 
\subparagraph{Trigger}
The request daily task event occurs before the beginning of a new day or during a data dump connection. The actual request is sent after authentication with the Server.
